new features to add:


A quick daily check-in. After dinner, a simple "How'd it go?" screen where you tap through each food from today's meals and rate them. Right now rating happens in the pantry or by tapping into a meal cell — a dedicated end-of-day flow would make it feel fast and routine, almost like a game.

Some personality. A streak counter for balanced meals, a "new foods tried this month" stat, maybe a simple progress visualization. Parents love seeing that they're doing a good job. Even something as small as "14-day streak of balanced lunches" is weirdly motivating.

Bottom tab bar instead of top tabs. Standard iOS convention, easier to reach with one thumb, and it gives you room for more sections (Pantry, Today, Week, Shopping List) without crowding the header.
